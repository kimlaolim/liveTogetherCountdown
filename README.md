# Let's Live Together!
This small project builds on a countdown website I originally made for my boyfriend when we were doing long distance. The original version featured only the header, timer, and cat-themed progress bars.
After we finished doing long distance, I wanted to make the website more interactive and reusable. With this project, I've added a date and time input feature that fits the website's pixelated theme so that any
user could set their own countdown and enjoy the website.

## How It's Made
